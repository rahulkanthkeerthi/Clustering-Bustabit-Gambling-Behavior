# Clustering-Bustabit-Gambling-Behavior

Have you ever wondered if you could quantify the behavior of gamblers at the casino? Some seem to win the most, some can be reckless and risky with their bets, and others are casual about the whole experience.
This data was collected on thousands of Bustabit gambling sessions and tracked the user, the amount bet, the amount won, and various properties of the particular game itself by using an online platform called Bustabit in which gamblers can bet Bitcoin. . Using this data, I have performed a cluster analysis from start to finish in an attempt to group gamblers based on their gambling behavior. The dataset used includes 10,000 games of Bustabit. Each game tracks the particular gambler, the BustedAt value of the game, and the multiplier at which the gambler cashed out.

Project Tasks:

•	Deriving relevant features for clustering
•	Creating per-player statistics
•	Scaling and normalization of the derived features
•	Clustering the player data using K means
•	Computing averages for each cluster
•	Visualizing the clusters with a Parallel Coordinate Plot
•	Visualizing the clusters with Principal Components
•	Analyzing the groups of gamblers our solution uncovered
